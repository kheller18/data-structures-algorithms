JavaScript, created by Brendan Eich in 1995, is one of the most widely used web development languages. It was designed to build dynamic web pages at first. A script is a JS program that may be added to the HTML of any web page. When the page loads, these scripts execute automatically.

Primitive Data Types (stores one value):
+ String - It represents a series of characters and is written with quotes. A string can be represented using a single or a double quote.
+ Number - It represents a number and can be written with or without decimals.
+ BigInt - This data type is used to store numbers which are above the limitation of the Number data type. It can store large integers and is represented by adding “n” to an integer literal.
+ Boolean - It represents a logical entity and can have only two values : true or false. Booleans are generally used for conditional testing.
+ Undefined - When a variable is declared but not assigned, it has the value of undefined and it’s type is also undefined.
+ Null - It represents a non-existent or a invalid value.
+ Symbol - It is a new data type introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. It is used to store an anonymous and unique value.

Non-Primative Data Types (can store multiple values):

Data Structures:
+ Objects - a standalone entity, with properties and type.
+ Arrays - linear collection of elements, which can be accessed via indices.
+ Lists (Abstract Data Type) - can be any data type. Creates a class. Each item in a list is called an element.
+ Stack - list of elements that are accessible only from one end of the list, which is the top. Stack is known as a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. Because of the last in, first-out nature of the stack, any element that is not currently at the top of the stack cannot be accessed, you have to dispose of the elements above it first.
+ Queue - type of list where data are inserted at the end and are removed from the front. Example of First-In, First Out (FIFO) data strucutre. Good example of a queue is to model scenarios such as customers standing in the line at a bank or a grocery store.
+ Linked Lists - collection of objects called nodes. Each node is linked to a successor node in the list using an object reference. The reference to another node is called a link. While array elements are referenced by their position, linked list elements are referenced by their relationship to the other elements in the linked list. We mark the end of the linked list with the "null" node. We mark the beginning of a linked list with the "head" node.
