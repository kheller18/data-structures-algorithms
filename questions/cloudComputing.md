## Background
Cloud computing is a way of providing shared computing resources. These resources include applications, computing, storage, networking, development and deployment platforms as well as business processes. By providing standardization and automation, cloud computing makes computing resources easier to use.

However, Cloud Computing doesn’t mean that it consists of only one cloud. The term ‘Cloud’ symbolizes the Internet, which in itself is a network of networks. Also, all forms of remote computing are not Cloud Computing.
