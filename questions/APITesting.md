# API Testing Interview Questions

---

## Background
API testing is a category of software testing that helps test systems defined as APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in terms of functionalities, performance, reliability, security, and various other parameters. This testing helps test the business logic of applications quickly and more effectively and helps identify bugs/defects in the functionality of the application at the business logic layer of the software application architecture as shown below:
