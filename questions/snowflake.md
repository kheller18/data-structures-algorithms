# Snowflake Interview Questions

---

## Background
Snowflake is basically a SaaS (Software as a service is a cloud-based method of providing software to users.) based data warehouse (DWH) platform that is built on the top of AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud infrastructures to provide companies with flexible, scalable storage solutions while also hosting BI (Business Intelligence) solutions. It serves as a centralized platform for data management, data lakes, data engineering, data applications development, data science, and secure sharing and consumption of real-time and shared data. Providing a centralized system to consolidate all data, Snowflake revolutionized the data warehousing industry. With Snowflake, you can simplify data warehouse management without sacrificing features.

To satisfy the demanding needs of growing enterprises, Snowflake includes out-of-the-box features such as storage and compute separation, on-the-fly scalable computing, data sharing, data cloning, and third-party tool support, etc. In comparison to traditional solutions, Snowflake delivers fast, easy-to-use, and flexible data storage, processing, and analytics.  A number of programming languages are supported by Snowflake, including Go, C, .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, etc.
