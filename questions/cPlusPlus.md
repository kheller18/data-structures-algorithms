# C++ Interview Questions

---

## Background
C++ is a powerful and all-purpose programming tool developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. This language is an extension of C and is by far one of the fastest object-oriented programming languages. C++ is super popular because of its high speed and compatibility.

It is widely used in the development of games and servers while some of the real-world applications of C++ are as follows
+ Operating systems
+ GUI based applications
+ Distributed systems
+ Database software
+ Banking applications
+ Advanced computations and graphics
+ Embedded systems
