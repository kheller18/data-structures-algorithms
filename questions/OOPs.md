# Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Interview Questions

---

## Background
OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model or paradigm which revolves around the concept of “OBJECTS”. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that contain some characteristics and behaviors specified in the class template.

In simple language, a class can be considered as the blueprint or template, based on which objects can be created. So the Objects are considered the instance of a class, and are therefore sometimes called “instances”. The term “characteristics” refers to the “what” about the Object, and the term “behavior” refers to the “how” about the Object.

For example, if we consider a car, then based on the OOPs model:

Class = A specific car model, such as Audi A4, BMW I8, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, etc.
Object = A specific car of any model, like the car you own
Characteristics = What is the color of your car? What is the Chassis number of your car? etc
Behavior = How to start the car? How to change the gear of the car? etc.
Characteristics are also known as data, attributes, or properties, and Behaviours are also known as the functions, procedures or methods, in the programming language.

The concept of “objects” allows the OOPs model to easily access, use and modify the instance data and methods, interact with other objects, and define methods in runtime (during the execution of the program). This gives the OOPs model significance and makes it diverse in its implementation.

In fact, the OOPs model is so popular, that many of the most widely used programming languages support and use this Object Oriented Programming or OOPs model, such as Java, C++, Python, C#, etc.
