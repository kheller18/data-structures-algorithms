13. What is an Interface?
    + `Interface`: a way of communicating between two objects. The objects can be software or hardware. An interface can be defined in many different ways, but the most common definition is that it is a way for one object to talk to another object. This communication can take many different forms, such as sending data to the other object, receiving data from the other object, or both. An interface can be implemented in many different ways, but the most common way is to use a software class. This class defines the interface and then other classes can use this class to implement the interface. When an object uses an interface, it is saying that it understands how the interface works and can use it to communicate with other objects.

14. What is an abstract class?
    + `Abstract Class`: a class that is not defined in the source code. Instead, it is defined in a file that contains a definition of the class. The file defines the class by defining all of the properties and methods of the class. However, the class does not have to be defined in the source code. Instead, it can be defined in a separate file that is included in the source code. The file can then be referenced by the source code. This allows the class to be abstract and still be defined in the source code. The main advantage of an abstract class is that it allows other classes to use the class without having to know all of its properties and methods. This makes it possible for other classes to use a class without knowing all of its properties and methods.

15. What is an array?
    + `Array`: a data structure that can hold a lot of data. Arrays are used in a lot of different applications, such as databases, spreadsheets, and games. Arrays are made up of different data types, such as numbers, strings, and characters. Arrays are also called indexed structures because they can be accessed by indexing. Arrays are one of the most important data structures in programming. They are used to store data in a way that is easy to access and to organize it in a way that makes sense.

      + `Simplicity`: All software should be easy to understand and maintain, and should not require complex configuration or customization.

22. Explain the access modifiers?
    + `Access modifiers`: a way of specifying which users have access to a resource. Access modifiers are often used to control access to data, files, or other resources. For example, a database might allow only certain users to see the data. Or, a file might be locked down so that only the owner can see it.

23. What do you mean by destructor?
    + `Destructor`: a function that is called when an object is destroyed. A destructor is a way to clean up after an object has been destroyed. When an object is destroyed, the memory associated with the object is released. When an object is created, the memory associated with the object is allocated. The destructor is called when the memory associated with the object is no longer needed. The destructor frees up the memory associated with the object and releases it into the environment. When an object is destroyed, it can be very difficult to find out why an object was destroyed.

24. What are the Layers of the OSI Model?
    + `OSI model`: a system-level networking model that describes the topology of a network. The model consists of seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Transport, Network, Application, and Management. Each layer is responsible for providing a specific function. For example, the Physical layer provides connectivity between devices and the Data Link layer is responsible for data transmission. The Transport layer is responsible for routing data and the Network layer is responsible for managing the network. The Application layer is responsible for providing services to the devices on the network and the Management layer is responsible for managing the network. Each layer in the OSI model has a specific purpose and each layer in the OSI model has a specific role to play in the overall system.

25. What is the thread in programming?
    + `Thread`: a fundamental concept in programming. It is a way of organizing and managing code so that it can run in parallel. The thread is a way of keeping code running in the background while the main program is running. Threads are used to parallelize tasks and to share resources among multiple threads. When the main program runs, it sends instructions to the thread that is running the task. When the task is done, the thread that was running the task sends instructions to the main program that is waiting for instructions. This process continues until all tasks are done or until one of them crashes or gets interrupted. Threads are a fundamental concept in programming because they allow programs to run in parallel and to share resources. They are also useful for managing memory and CPU usage.

26. What is the primary memory in programming?
    + `Primary Memory`: in programming is the data structure that is used to store the information that is used by the program to control the execution of the program. The primary memory is composed of variables, constants, and data types. The variables are used to store information about the current state of the program. The constants are used to store values that are known at compile-time and are needed by the program when it is run. The data types are used to store values that are known at runtime and are needed by the program when it is run.
      + The primary memory in programming is composed of three different types of data structures:
        + `Variables`: These are used to store information about the current state of the program. Variables can be used to store values such as numbers, strings, and booleans.
        + `Constants`: These are used to store values that are known at compile-time and are needed by the program when it is run. Constants can be used to store values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans.
        + `Data types`: These are used to store values that are known at runtime and are needed by the program when it is run. Data types can be used to store values such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries.

27. What is the internet?
    + `Internet`: a worldwide network of computers and devices that enables people to share information, ideas, and products.

30. What is cryptography?
    + `Cryptography`: the science and art of creating and using codes and ciphers to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. Cryptography is used to protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Cryptography can also be used to secure data transmissions, such as e-mail and web browsing. Cryptography also plays an important role in the security of computer networks, such as the Internet. Codes and ciphers are used to encode and decode information. For example, when you type in a password on a computer, the computer uses a code to encrypt the password. When you send an e-mail, you use a code to encrypt the message.
      ![cryptography](../images/computer-science/cryptography.png)

31. What is a singleton class?
    + `Singleton Class`: a class that is defined once and only once. This can be used to reduce the number of classes you need to define in your application, and it can also be used to reduce the complexity of your code. When you define a singleton class, you are declaring that the class is only ever going to be created once. This can be useful if you want to reduce the number of instances that your class will have to create, and it can also be useful if you want to reduce the complexity of your code. Singleton classes are often used when you need to create a single instance of a class, but you don't want that instance to be shared across multiple objects. For example, if you want to create a single instance of a class that represents an image, you might create a singleton class that represents that image.

32. Is string class final?
    + Yes. The string class is final. This means that you cannot subclass it, and you cannot override its methods. This is a good thing because it means that you can use the string class without worrying about its internal state. There are a few things that you can do to subclass the string class, though. First, you can use StringBuilder to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Second, you can use StringBuffer to create a subclass of the string class. This class can then override the methods that you need to override to create your own subclass of the string class. Finally, you can use StringBuilder and StringBuffer together to create a subclass of the string class.

33. What is a wrapper class?
    + `Wrapper Class`: a class that inherits from another class and then provides a set of methods and/or properties that are specific to its own purpose. Wrappers are typically used to hide implementation details from the user, allowing the developer to concentrate on the business logic. A wrapper class can be used to hide implementation details from the user, allowing the developer to concentrate on the business logic. Wrappers can also be used to provide a set of methods and/or properties that are specific to their own purpose. The main advantage of wrappers is that they allow you to hide implementation details from the user, allowing you to concentrate on the business logic. The main disadvantage of wrappers is that they can be difficult to maintain.

34. What are multiple inheritances in Java?
    + `Multiple inheritances`: a way of passing on multiple copies of a particular class or interface to a child's class. This can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. One way to do this is to create a subclass of the parent class, and then provide the child with a copy of the parent class. Another way is to create multiple inheritances in your Java code, and then provide the child with a reference to the parent class. Multiple inheritances are useful for situations where you need to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes. In Java, multiple inheritances are implemented using the public and private modifiers on a class or interface. When multiple inheritances are present, the public modifier indicates that the class or interface is publically accessible. The private modifier indicates that the class or interface is privately accessible. Multiple inheritances can be useful when you want to make sure that some code is always available to your child's classes.
      ![multiple inheritances](../images/python/multiple_inheritance.png)

35. What is Cache?
    + `Cache`: a temporary storage location for frequently accessed data. Caches are useful for organizations that need to store large amounts of data in a short amount of time. They can also be used to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the network. Caches can be used to store data in several different ways. They can be used to store data that is frequently accessed, such as documents or images. They can also be used to store data that is rarely accessed, such as log files or application states. They can also be used to store data that is needed only occasionally, such as temporary files or cookies.
      ![cache](../images/computer-science/cache_memory.png)

36. What is Deadlock?
    + `Deadlock`: a situation where two or more processes are waiting for each other to finish. Deadlock occurs when one process is waiting for another process to finish before it can continue. The process that is waiting will not finish until the other process finishes. This can be a problem if you need to wait for a long time, as this can lead to your system becoming unresponsive.
      ![deadlock](../images/computer-science/deadlock.png)

37. What is a Critical Section?
    + `Critical Section`: a section of code that is crucial to the operation of a program. By accessing critical sections, a program can make changes to the overall functionality of the program without affecting other sections of code. Critical sections are often accessed through functions, methods, and variables. The purpose of a critical section is to ensure that all parts of the program are working properly.
      ![critical_section](../images/computer-science/critical_section.png)

38. What is Multithreading?
    + `Multithreading`: a technique that allows multiple threads to run in parallel on a single processor. This allows multiple tasks to be run in parallel without the need for synchronization. In addition, multithreading can improve performance by allowing tasks to run in parallel without having to wait for each other to finish. For example, it is not appropriate for applications that require high performance or when the processor cannot support more than one thread at a time. Multithreading also has its own set of risks and pitfalls. For example, multithreading can lead to increased system load and increased system resource consumption.

39. What is normalization in a Database?
    + `Normalization`: is a process of abstracting and simplifying data. It is a way of making data easier to understand and easier to work with. For example, if you have a data set that contains a lot of numbers, you can normalize it by taking the numbers and breaking them down into smaller pieces, such as by dividing by 10. This makes it easier to work with the data and makes it easier to see trends and patterns. You can also normalize your data by making it more consistent.

40. What is Indexing in DBMS?
    + `Indexing`: the process of organizing data in a way that makes it easier to find and access. In a database, the index is a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to search and find data. The index consists of a set of key-value pairs that can be used to reference data in the database. The indexing process can involve many different techniques, including the use of indexes, data structures, and algorithms. In a database, the index is a collection of data organized in a way that makes it easy to search and find data.

41. Explain firewalls?
    + `Firewalls`: software programs that are used to protect your computer from viruses and other malware. They are also used to protect your privacy and to keep unauthorized people from accessing your computer. Firewalls are often used in conjunction with antivirus software.

TCP also provides several other functions, such as error detection and recovery, congestion control, and reliability.
      ![TCP](../images/computer-science/tcp.png)

43. Explain Domain Name System (DNS)?
    + `Domain Name System (DNS)`: a way of mapping domain names to IP addresses. The IP address is a number that's assigned to each device that connects to the Internet. When you type in a domain name, your computer sends a request to the DNS server, which looks up the corresponding IP address. The DNS server then returns a response that includes the domain name and an associated IP address. This process is called name resolution. DNS is used by most websites and services that use the Internet. It's also used by email services like Gmail and Yahoo Mail, as well as by many online services like shopping sites and online banking services.
      ![DNS](../images/computer-science/dns.png)

44. What are the Application layer protocols?
