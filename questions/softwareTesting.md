# Software Testing Interview Questions

---

## Background
Software testing is an activity conducted in the software development life-cycle to verify that the software is accurate and works according to the requirements. Testing plays an integral part in any software development project.

In its essence, software testing aims to answer the question: How does one ensure that the software does what it is supposed to do and doesn’t do what it is not supposed to do? The primary goal behind software testing is to get enough confidence that the software under testing produces the correct output for a given input.

An important thing to keep in mind when learning about software testing is that testing does not improve software quality by itself. Or that a high amount of testing doesn’t mean that the software is high quality. Testing is an indicator of quality, providing crucial feedback to the developers who created the software to take necessary action to fix the problems found in testing.

This article provides the frequently asked interview questions by the interviewer for a Software Tester or Quality Assurance (QA) position. It’s divided into three sections based on the skill set of the applicant. The fresher’s section includes software testing questions you might get asked for a junior-level position if you are recently graduated from college.

The experienced section assumes basic familiarity with the testing process and explores the advanced topics in testing. This section is suitable for someone with a few years of experience as a tester. In the end, multiple-choice questions are provided to test your understanding of testing.
