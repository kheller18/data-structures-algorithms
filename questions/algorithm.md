# Algorithm Interview Questions

---

## Background
Algorithms and Data Structures are a crucial component of any technical coding interview. It does not matter if you are a C++ programmer, a Java programmer, or a Web developer using JavaScript, Angular, React, JQuery, or any other programming language.

A programmer should have a thorough understanding of both basic data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, hash tables, stacks, and queues, etc. and conventional algorithms, such as Binary Search, Dynamic Programming, and so on. Therefore, in this article we would be mostly focussing on Algorithms - an introduction to algorithms, a lot of algorithms interview questions which are being asked in the coding interviews of various companies and also a few Algorithms MCQs which we think everyone should practice in order to have a better understanding of algorithms.

Now, the very first question which must be popping in your head must be "What is an algorithm?" Well, the answer to this question is: An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a class of problems or conduct a computation in mathematics and computer science.

Algorithms are used to specify how calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision making, and other tasks should be done. An algorithm is a method for calculating a function that can be represented in a finite amount of space and time and in a well defined formal language. The instructions describe a computation that, when run, continues through a finite number of well defined subsequent stages, finally creating "output" and terminating at a final ending state, starting from an initial state and initial input (possibly empty). The shift from one state to the next is not always predictable; some algorithms, known as randomised algorithms, take random input into account.


### The Need For Algorithms (Advantages of Algorithms):
Before diving deep into algorithm interview questions, let us first understand the need for Algorithms in today's world. The following are some of the benefits of using algorithms in real-world problems.

+ Algorithms boost the effectiveness of an existing method.
+ It is easy to compare an algorithm's performance to those of other approaches using various methods (Time Complexity, Space Complexity, etc.).
+ Algorithms provide the designers with a detailed description of the criteria and goals of the problems.
+ They also enable a reasonable comprehension of the program's flow.
+ Algorithms evaluate how well the approaches work in various scenarios (Best cases, worst cases, average cases).
+ An algorithm also determines which resources (input/output, memory) cycles are necessary.
+ We can quantify and assess the problem's complexity in terms of time and space using an algorithm.
+ The cost of design is also reduced if proper algorithms are used.
